File 1: loki-config.yml

This is the configuration file for Loki, a log aggregation system. It defines how Loki operates, stores data, and manages log retention.

Authentication: auth_enabled: false - No authentication is required to access Loki.
Server: Configures Loki to listen for HTTP requests on port 3100 on all network interfaces.
Ingestion: Configures the ingester's lifecycle and log chunk retention settings.
Schema: Defines the schema for indexing logs, using boltdb for the index and filesystem for storing log chunks.
Storage: Specifies where Loki stores indexes (/loki/index) and log chunks (/loki/chunks) locally on the filesystem.
Retention: Keeps logs for 30 days (720 hours) and enables log deletion after the retention period.
Limits: Rejects logs older than 7 days (168 hours) to ensure only recent logs are ingested.


File 2: docker-compose.yml

This file is used to define and run the Loki service as a container using Docker Compose.

Image: Uses the latest Loki image from Docker Hub (grafana/loki:latest).
Container Name: Names the Loki container as loki.
Ports: Maps port 3100 from the container to the host, making Loki accessible.
Volumes: Mounts the loki-config.yml file into the container to provide Loki with its configuration.
